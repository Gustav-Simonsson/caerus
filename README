Usage
-----

Include as a rebar dependency and start the gen_server under your apps
supervisor. See typespecs in the caerus module for the exported functions/API.

Quick start:

```sh
rebar get-deps
rebar compile
./start.sh
```

Dependencies
-----

1. Erlang (tested with R16B02)
2. rebar [2]
2. curl (tested with version 7.32.0) (curl is launched as a Erlang port, this
   may cause incompatibility on other *nix OSs due to different curl flags.
3. The authenticated parts of the cryptsy API requires a active cryptsy account
   and a public API key. See [1] below.

Tested on Ubuntu 13.10 with Erlang R16B02

Configuration
-----

See priv/config/local.config - without a configured cryptsy API key, only the
non-authenticated parts of the cryptsy API is available.
